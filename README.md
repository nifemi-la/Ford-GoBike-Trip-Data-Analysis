# Ford-GoBike-Trip-Data-Analysis
Bike Service Usage Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the usage patterns of a bike sharing service based on the Ford GoBike System Dataset provided. The analysis focuses on exploring the trends in trip duration, user demographics, and usage patterns across different days of the week.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about bike trips, including start and end times, station IDs, station names, user types, member demographics, and bike share status.

## Analysis
The analysis includes the following key insights:

- Trip Duration Trends: Investigation into the duration of bike trips and their variation based on different factors such as day of the week, user type, and gender.
- User Demographics: Exploration of the demographic characteristics of bike service users, including gender distribution and user type breakdown.
- Usage Patterns: Examination of the frequency of bike service usage across different hours of the day and days of the week.
